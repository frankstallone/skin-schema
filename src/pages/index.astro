          <p>
            I'm an experienced photographer and videographer, and created Skin
            Schema to showcase my passion for beauty and skincare through a lens
            of authenticity and elegance.

              <section>
                Having developed a loyal, trusting following, I'm now opening
                both my experience and feed to collaboration opportunities with
                a select number of partners. Whether you want to lift your own
                brand's social media presence with high-quality, captivating
                visuals, or engage with my devoted, growing beauty audience, I
                offer the below bespoke collaboration options. Let's create
                stunning content together.

      <h2>Collaboration options</h2>
      <p>
        All of my services come in two options - either as content I create for
        your own use, or content I create and share to my Skin Schema feed.
      </p>

          </h3>
          <h4 class="mt-2xs text-step-2">For Brand Use</h4>
          <p>
            Showcase your products in beautifully curated content designed
            exclusively for your social media feeds. Each piece will be
            professionally planned, shot, and edited to feel minimal, airy, and
            elegant. The finished product will be delivered to you in multiple
            formats tailored for use across various platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will own the rights to post this content anywhere, anytime,
            forever - the only requirement is that you tag Skin Schema's
            Instagram account when you do.

            Let your products shine on Skin Schema's Instagram feed, reaching a
            highly engaged audience that values my genuine beauty insights. This
            option is perfect for brands looking to benefit from the authentic
            connection and trust I've earned with my followers, who regularly
            turn to me for skincare opinions and recommendations.
